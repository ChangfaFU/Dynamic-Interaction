# Dynamic-Interaction
The project aims to investigate the dynamic interaction between energy market and financial performance in Australia by identifying the structual breaks and modifying multivariate GARCH models.
Currently, I have just run the GARCH model to fit the market data, which appear insignificance among data. Thus, I began to modify the models and will publish them once I finished it.
Machine learning would be used to identify the structual breaks in time series.
